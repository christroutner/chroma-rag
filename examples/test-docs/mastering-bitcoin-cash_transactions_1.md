# Transaction Fundamentals

Transactions are the core of the Bitcoin Cash system. They encode value transfers between participants in the network. Each transaction becomes a public entry in Bitcoin Cash's blockchain, which functions as a global double-entry bookkeeping ledger.

A transaction's lifecycle begins with creation (origination), followed by signing with one or more digital signatures that authorize spending the funds. The transaction is then broadcast to the Bitcoin Cash network, where nodes validate and propagate it until it reaches most nodes. Eventually, a mining node verifies it and includes it in a block. Once recorded and confirmed by subsequent blocks, the transaction becomes permanent, and the funds allocated to new owners can be spent in future transactions.
